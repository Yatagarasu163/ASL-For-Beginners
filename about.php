                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp American Sign Language is a language that is used by people that aren't able to communicate verbally to convey their thoughts and feelings. Instead of speaking, ASL uses a combination of hand, body and facial movements to convey meaning to those around them. For example, hand signs represent letters, words and phrases, facial expression is used to show emotions or tone and body movements make the conversation flow naturally similar to how our voice tone changes while speaking. <br>
                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  ASL isn't just a signed version of English, it has its own grammar and rules. It's like learning a whole new language but through gestures instead of spoken words. It is used in USA and Canada, as well as in Malaysia and is a beautiful way for people to connect with each other when spoken language isn't an option.
